I am a PhD student working on rehabiltiation robot and Machine learning.
My work is mainly processing realtime physiological signals
and developing controls based on the signals generally using machine learning.

I like reading and writing about machine learning and robotics.

If you want to have a chat about machine learning or robotics, reach out to me.
